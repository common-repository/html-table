CSS tables are pretty simple to understand and use. It’s mostly a matter of remembering the corresponding css display property values for the basic html table elements.

table becomes display: table. td becomes display: table-cell, etc.

There are some nice features of css tables like the ability to collapse one or more columns through the visibility: collapse property and they can be used as solutions to some specific problems.

However they don’t provide enough advantage for me over html tables when it comes to layout. Their advantages seem minor and a bit of a reach. Ultimately I think we have better layout solutions than both html and css tables.

Again though I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

Have you used css tables in practice? If so how? Have you used them for site layout? To present tabular data? To solve a specific problem?

This plugin is a fork on Data Tables Generator by Supsystic. Thank you for making good foundation for a good plugin.
